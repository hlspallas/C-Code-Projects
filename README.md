# C-Code-Projects

This GitHub repository contains a collection of some of my coding projects in C language. 

The purpose of this repository is to track my coding projects and continually make them better and run more efficiently.
All of these codes are no older than 2017 and a lot of them have been recently edited and added to.
Some of the coding files require a .txt files of which I have added to a separate folder in the repository.

Two of the biggest projects I have worked on include a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI and a card game called 'Joker' which is also played with an AI.
Another coding project that is different from the rest includes a code that interfaces with an Arduino.
This Arduino code randomizes the times between when a surface-mounted LED blinks and keeps track of: (1.) How long the program has been running for (2.) and the time elapsed between each of the blinks.
