# C-Code-Projects

This GitHub repository contains a collection of some of my coding projects in C language. 

The purpose of this repository is to track my coding projects and continually make them better and run more efficiently.
All of these codes are no older than 2017 and a lot of them have been recently edited and added to.
Some of the coding files require a .txt files of which I have added to a separate folder in the repository.

Two of the biggest projects I have worked on include a Tic Tac Toe game against an AI and a card game called 'Joker' which is also played against an AI.
These are in the repository as: "TICTACTOE_Game_Code" and "Joker_CardGame_Code."

Another coding project that is different from the rest includes a code that interfaces with an Arduino.
This Arduino code randomizes the times between each blink of a surface-mounted LED and keeps track of: (1.) How long the program has been running for (2.) and the time elapsed between each of the blinks. It can be modified to blink (set as high or 1) whenever the user wants it to.
